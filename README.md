I have nothing important to put here yet! one fateful day in the future though, this ReadMe file will be rich
in content and give exquisite information about the usage of this program. For now, you can sit back and imagine
what it could be like looking at this same page in the context of the full release of this program. Here, i'll
give you a spoiler. There will DEFINITELT be something along the lines of "You need to download java to use this program"!
I hope that's getting you real hyped, because I know I am. that's actually a lie im not really excited because then
ill have to replace this current ReadMe file and that will make me very, very sad. Don't think about that though,
I don't want to ruin your experience of the final ReadMe file with my personal feelings.

Farewell my dear reader. We shall meet again.
